# Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing: #

## i. Importing and Loading Datasets ##

The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle named “Adidas Sales Dataset” and was converted from an XLSX file to a CSV file for easier handling. The datasets then loaded into MySQL Workbench by creating schema and importing the CSV file into table.

## ii. Checking the Shape of Data Frame ##
Determining the shape of a DataFrame is important because it provides immediate insight into the size of the dataset, revealing the number of rows and columns.

## iii. Checking for Null Values ##
Null values can distort analysis results. Identifying the count of null values in each column helps in deciding how to handle them.

## iv. Checking any Duplicate Values ##
This process involves identifying and counting any duplicate rows in the dataset. Duplicate data can skew analysis results and should be addressed if present. There were no duplicated rows in the dataset.

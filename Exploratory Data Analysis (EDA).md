## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) ##

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential step in understanding and preparing the data for analysis. During EDA, we delve into the dataset’s various aspects to uncover insights and patterns that can guide our analysis. This step helps us identify missing values, outliers, trends, correlations, and potential variables of interest. By visualizing the data, we gain an initial understanding of its distribution, central tendencies, and any inherent structure. EDA also aids in formulating hypotheses for further analysis.
The EDA phase allowed us to:
. Understand the dataset’s structure, dimensions, and basic information.
. Spot and remove any duplicate entries to ensure the accuracy of our findings.
. Chart the progression of sales over different timeframes, notably years and months.
. Investigate how sales figures varied month-to-month.
This process provides a strong foundation for making data-driven decisions and deriving meaningful insights from the dataset.

## vii. Is there a specific price range that achieves better sales than others?  ##
To identify which price range yields the highest revenue, I sort the aggregated data in descending order of ‘Total Revenue’.

The highest total sales are in the price range of 45 to 65 (56,47,09,291), indicating that products priced within this range are very popular or in high demand. This could indicate a sweet spot for pricing where customers are more willing to purchase.

Very low-priced products (below 30) and higher-priced products (above 75) show significantly lower sales. This might be due to various factors like perceived value, product quality, target customer segment, or availability.

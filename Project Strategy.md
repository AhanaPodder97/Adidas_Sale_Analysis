# Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing: #

## i. Importing and Loading Datasets ##

The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle named “Adidas Sales Dataset” and was converted from an XLSX file to a CSV file for easier handling. The datasets then loaded into MySQL Workbench by creating schema and importing the CSV file into table.
